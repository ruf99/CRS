# CRSCancel changes

A course registration system (CRS) created using object oriented programming.

==========================================================

I created a mock university course registration system for my data structures class.  
This project involves an admin, and a student. The Admin can manage courses, and view reports.
The student can register for classes similar to an actual university enrollment system.

I used serialization and ArrayLists to keep the data in sync.
To use this code, you will need login credentials.

Student (default): 
Username: JD
